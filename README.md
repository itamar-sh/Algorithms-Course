## Greedy Algorithms
This is concept of solving problems with iterations such that each iteration we try to "catch" as many as we can.

## Dynamic Algorithms
Many problems are composed from smaller problems from the same type.
So we try to divide the task into small tasks, mostly using Matrix of tasks.
